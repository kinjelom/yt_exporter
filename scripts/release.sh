# yt_exporter - cut a release
#
# One command takes the repository from "the code is ready" to "version X.Y.Z
# exists on GitHub, with binaries for every platform in RELEASE_PLATFORMS and a
# container image".
#
#   1. preflight   git is clean, on the release branch, the tag is free,
#                  the tools needed for the steps you asked for are installed
#   2. test        scripts/test.sh - gofmt, vet, unit tests
#   3. changelog   promote the Unreleased section to the new version
#   4. package     scripts/dist.sh - archives + SHA-256 checksums
#   5. image       scripts/image.sh - the container image
#   6. tag         commit the changelog, annotate the tag vX.Y.Z
#   7. publish     push the branch and the tag, push the image,
#                  create the GitHub release and upload the archives
#
# Nothing leaves the machine before step 7, and everything that can fail has
# failed by then - so a half-published release is not a state you can reach by
# a test failing.
#
# The version lives in git tags and nowhere else. There is no VERSION file to
# forget, and a version that was never tagged cannot be claimed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh patch              # 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1
#   scripts/release.sh minor              # 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0
#   scripts/release.sh major              # 1.2.0 -> 2.0.0
#   scripts/release.sh 2.0.0-rc.1         # an exact version
#   scripts/release.sh patch --dry-run    # print the plan, change nothing
#
# Flags:
#   --dry-run        do everything local, publish nothing, touch no file
#   --no-image       skip the container image
#   --no-publish     build and tag locally, push nothing
#   --allow-dirty    release from a working tree with uncommitted changes
#   --allow-branch   release from a branch other than DEFAULT_BRANCH
#   --notes-file F   use F as the release notes instead of the changelog
#   --yes            do not ask for confirmation
#
# Credentials come from the environment: GITHUB_TOKEN for gh and ghcr.io, or
# REGISTRY_USER / REGISTRY_PASSWORD for another registry.
