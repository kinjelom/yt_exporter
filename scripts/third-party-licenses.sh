# yt_exporter - licenses of the code compiled into the binary
#
# Writes to stdout the license texts of the Go standard library and runtime and
# of every module `go list -deps` reports for ./cmd/yt_exporter on the target
# platform - GOOS/GOARCH from the environment, as for `go build`. That is what
# the binary contains, not what go.mod mentions: test dependencies are left out,
# and some modules are linked on some platforms only. Their licenses (MIT, BSD,
# Apache 2.0) require the license text to travel with the binary, Apache 2.0
# also the NOTICE file, so every LICENSE, COPYING and NOTICE file at a module's
# root is copied. A module without one is an error: shipping it would need its
# license checked by hand first.
#
# scripts/dist.sh puts the result into every release archive and the
# Dockerfile into the image, both as THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt. The modules must
# be in the module cache (go mod download, or a build before).
#
# POSIX sh rather than bash like the other scripts: it also runs in the alpine
# build stage of the Dockerfile, which has no bash.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/third-party-licenses.sh > THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt
#   GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 scripts/third-party-licenses.sh --title "yt_exporter 1.2.0 for windows/amd64"
