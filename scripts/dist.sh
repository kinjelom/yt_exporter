# yt_exporter - cross-compile the release matrix into dist/
#
# For every platform in RELEASE_PLATFORMS (release.conf) it produces one
# archive holding the binary, the documentation and THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt,
# then one checksums file covering all of them:
#
#   dist/yt_exporter_1.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
#   dist/yt_exporter_1.2.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
#   dist/yt_exporter_1.2.0_windows_amd64.zip
#   dist/yt_exporter_1.2.0_checksums.txt
#
# These are the files scripts/release.sh uploads to the GitHub release. The
# names are part of that contract - a consumer builds the download URL from
# them - so they are computed in one place, scripts/lib.sh.
#
# Files inside an archive sit at its root, not under a directory, so a consumer
# can extract just the binary:
#
#   tar -xzf yt_exporter_1.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz yt_exporter
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dist.sh                     # version from git describe
#   scripts/dist.sh --version 1.2.0     # the version a release will carry
#   scripts/dist.sh --platforms "linux/amd64 linux/arm64"
